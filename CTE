Here is a SQL query using a CTE to call the number of total customers and the number of top customers from the top countries


WITH top_five_cte (first_name, last_name, city, country, customer_id, total_amount_paid)
  AS (SELECT A.first_name,
  A.last_name,
  C.city,
  D.country,
  E.customer_id,
  SUM(amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM payment E
INNER JOIN customer A ON E.customer_id = A.customer_id
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = c.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
WHERE city IN ('Aurora', 'Adoni', 'Ozamis', 'Kurashiki', 'Xintai'
  'Sivas', 'Dhule (Dhulia)', 'Jakarta', 'San Bernadino',
   'Pingxiang')
GROUP BY E.customer_id, first_name, last_name, city, country
ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
LIMIT 5
)
SELECT D.country,
  COUNT (DISTINCT A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
  COUNT(E.customer_id) AS top_customer_count
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B on A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
LEFT JOIN top_five_cte E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
GROUP BY D.country
HAVING COUNT(E.customer_id) > 0
ORDER BY (all_customer_count) DESC
;
